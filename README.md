# better_lr

A better implementation of generalized linear regression in Python! We are going to implement the linear regression or logistic regression by state-of-the-art algorithm in numerical optimization. Our package will have three major parts, generating the data, implementing the algorithm, and visualizing the result.


- data generation function
- algorithm function
- visualization function


statsmodels Python package have the similar functionality. But the algorithm we use may be different from the existed one.

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install better_lr
```

## Usage

We can use this package to find the coefficient of linear regression or logistic regression.
