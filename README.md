# lr_cd

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/lr-cd/badge/?version=latest)](https://lr-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)


A better implementation of the linear regression in Python! We are going to implement the linear regression by coordinate descent (CD) algorithm. Our package will have three major parts, including 1. data generation, 2. coordinate descent algorithm, and 3. visualization. Please refer to the link for additional details about the [coordinate descent (CD) algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_descent) if you are unfamiliar with it.

## Functions

There are three major functions in this package:

- `generate_data_lr(n, theta, random_seed=123)`: this function generates many random data points based on the theta coefficients, which will later be used for model fitting.
- `coordinate_descent(X, y, Ïµ=1e-6, max_iterations=1000)`: this function performs coordinate descent to minimize the mean squared error of linear regression and therefore outputs the optimized intercept and coefficients vector.
- `plot_lr(X, y, intercept, coef)`: this function returns a scatter plot of the observed data points overlayed with a regression with optimized intercept and coefficients vector.

## Python Ecosystem Context

`LinearRegression` in Python package `scikit-learn` has a similar functionality. However, we use a different algorithm in the implementation and believe it will be a better one. `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression` contains a few optimization functions: `scipy.linalg.lstsq`, `scipy.sparse.linalg.lsqr` and `scipy.optimize.nnls` which basically rely on the singular value decomposition of feature matrix X.

See the links for more information on [`sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html#ordinary-least-squares).

## Prerequisites

Make sure Miniconda or Anaconda is installed on your system

## Installation

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:UBC-MDS/lr_cd.git
cd lr_cd  # Navigate to the cloned repository directory
```

#### Step 2: Create and Activate the Conda Environment

```bash
# Method 1: create Conda Environment from the environment.yml file
conda env create -f environment.yml  # Create Conda environment
conda activate lr_cd  # Activate the Conda environment

# Method 2: create Conda Environment 
conda create --name lr_cd python=3.9 -y
conda activate lr_cd
```
 

#### Step 3: Install the Package Using Poetry

Ensure the Conda environment is activated (you should see (lr_cd) in the terminal prompt)

```bash
poetry install  # Install the package using Poetry
```

#### Step 4: Get the coverage
```bash
# Check line coverage
pytest --cov=lr_cd

# Check branch coverage
pytest --cov-branch --cov=lr_cd
poetry run pytest --cov-branch --cov=src
poetry run pytest --cov-branch --cov=lr_cd --cov-report html
```


## Troubleshooting

1. Environment Creation Issues: Ensure environment.yml is in the correct directory and you have the correct Conda version

2. Poetry Installation Issues: Verify Poetry is correctly installed in the Conda environment and your pyproject.toml file is properly configured

## Usage

We can use this package to find the optimized intercept and coefficients vector of linear regression.

Example usage:

```python
>>> from lr_cd.lr_data_generation import generate_data_lr
>>> import numpy as np
>>> theta = np.array([4, 3])
>>> X, y = generate_data_lr(n=10, n_features=1, theta=theta)

>>> from lr_cd.lr_cd import coordinate_descent
>>> intercept, coef, _ = coordinate_descent(X, y)

>>> from lr_cd.lr_plotting import plot_lr
>>> plot_lr(X, y, intercept, coef)
```
